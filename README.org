* Controlling LEDs over WiFi

  Uses ESP8266 that talks to 1 or more Pro Minis over I2c bus that have 2 16 bit resolution PWM pins.

  You can talk to ESP8266 over OSC (Open Sound Control) protocol and tell it to change brightness of LEDs.

** Hardware
   - ESP8266 (I use D1 mini)
   - Arduino Pro Mini. I have some clones. I use 5V 16Mhz 168 version. It works on 3v3 for me, so no need for i2c power level converters.

** Setup
   SSID and password for WiFi network is defined in "esp8266_osc_server/src/wifi_network.h", use wifi_network_example.h as a reference.

** Upload firmware
   1. Install platformio

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   platformio run -t upload --upload-port /dev/ttyUSB0
   #+END_SRC

   Replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with your UART or remove it and --upload-port argument and hope platformio guesses correctly.
